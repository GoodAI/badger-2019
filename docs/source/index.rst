Badger
======

*A memory-based multi-agent meta-learning architecture and learning procedure*


The Badger architecture allows for learning of a shared communication policy that enables the emergence of rapid adaptation to new and unseen environments by learning to learn learning algorithms through communication. Behavior, adaptation and learning to adapt emerges from the interactions of homogeneous experts inside a single agent. The proposed architecture should allow for generalization beyond the level seen in existing methods, in part due to the use of a single policy shared by all experts within the agent as well as the inherent modularity of the architecture.
