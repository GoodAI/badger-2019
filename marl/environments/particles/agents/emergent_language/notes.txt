TODO:
--------
[x] Weight saving
[x] Add a test mode where utterances are argmaxed instead of Gumbel-softmaxed
[x] Add a way to "replay" an episode easily
[x] Better loss over time information printing
[x] Batching
[x] Test role of comms by testing in envs where each agent knows its goal vs it doesn't
    [x] Make it possible to have agent get its own goal, determinable with a flag
    [x] Make this a training flag
    [ ] Test how this affects performance
[x] Get avg final distance of agents to their goals
[x] Goal predictions(relative to yourself and agent index)

HYPERPARAMETER TUNING:
-------------------------


LEARNING END:
-------------
[ ] Try relative goals (left of landmark, above landmark), see if relative direction words evolve
[ ] Give different award coefficients to goals, have a single agent have multiple goals, see if award values can be communicated

DISTANT FUTURE:
--------------
[ ] Visualization of a game
[ ] Web interface to give an initial game state and see how the agents act and what they utter


Unstructured thoughts:
----------------
- Color words
  - Simulate different visual systems, see how color words evolve
- Verbs
  - GO
  - TAKE (i.e. make landmarks movable, have a goal be the moving of a landmark to another landmark)
- Make sequential goals (i.e. go to blue, then green) and also multi-landmark but not ordered goals (go to green and blue in any order). See if a way to discriminate evolves
- Narration (Agent A observes a certain environment, tries to describe it to Agent B, Agent B predicts the environment history)
